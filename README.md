# Billiards_Computer_Animation

This project is a simulation of real time physics behind a game of physics and is implemented using UNITY3D and scripting is done in c#.
There are video demos included to showcase modularity with changes in friction adn energy loss by manipulating co-efficients of friction and co-efficient of restitution. The videos can also be found on my Youtube channel -SanketSheth CS
